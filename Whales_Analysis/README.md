## Whales_Analysis
This project oversees/manages large funds, also known as "whales".  The whales analysis is essentially a risk analysis, keeping track of risk management using daily returns, standard deviations, sharpe ratios, and betas.  

The outcome of the analysis will determine risk, risk/returns, volatality, and overall performance of particular funds (BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC, SOROS FUND MANAGEMENT LLC, PAULSON & CO INC, TIGER GLOBAL MANAGEMENT LLC) against the S&P 500.  

The Whales analysis will show the user charts/calculations which will provide visualization and more knowledge on which fund would be best to invest in given their preference of risk, etc.  

## Required Technologies 
Python 3.10.1
Jupyter lab 
Pandas
numpy
matplotlib
pathlib
csv files with net asset values (NAV)

## Installation Guide

Installing Python (MacOS):

## Usage 

As a user, I want to recieve analytics on funds' risk/reward based on the NAV csv files.  

The application will be able to provide the user with analytics, including visualization.  

Below is an example of what the analysis will look like for the user:

## License

license() A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE ==========================

Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands as a successor of a language called ABC. Guido remains Python's principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.

In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us) in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the software.

In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team. In October of the same year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became Zope Corporation. In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see https://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property. Zope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.

All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for the Open Source Definition). Historically, most, but not all, Python Hit Return for more, or q (and Return) to quit: releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes the various releases.

Release Derived Year Owner GPL- from compatible? (1)

0.9.0 thru 1.2 1991-1995 CWI yes 1.3 thru 1.5.2 1.2 1995-1999 CNRI yes 1.6 1.5.2 2000 CNRI no 2.0 1.6 2000 BeOpen.com no 1.6.1 1.6 2001 CNRI yes (2) 2.1 2.0+1.6.1 2001 PSF no 2.0.1 2.0+1.6.1 2001 PSF yes 2.1.1 2.1+2.0.1 2001 PSF yes 2.1.2 2.1.1 2002 PSF yes 2.1.3 2.1.2 2002 PSF yes 2.2 and above 2.1.1 2001-now PSF yes Footnotes:

(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under the GPL. All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute a modified version without making your changes open source. The Hit Return for more, or q (and Return) to quit: GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.

(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible, because its license has a choice of law clause. According to CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1 is "not incompatible" with the GPL.

Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's direction to make these releases possible.
